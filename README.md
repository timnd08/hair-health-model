This project focuses on exploring predictive modelling techniques to identify and analyze patterns of baldness using the Hair Health dataset from Kaggle. The primary objective is to train and evaluate various machine learning models using multiple techniques, compare their performance, and gain insights into which approaches are the most effective in detecting baldness-related trends. Our plan focuses not only on building accurate models but also critically analyzing their strengths, limitations, and applicability in this domain.
